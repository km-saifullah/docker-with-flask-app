# Dockerizing a Python Flask Application

In this project, I will demonstrate how to create a simple Python application using the Flask framework and then containerize it using Docker. You can follow the steps outlined below to achieve the same result.

## Step-1: Create the necessary directories and files required to structure and run the Flask application

Create the projectâ€™s root directory and initialize all the necessary files required for building and running the Flask application.

```bash
mkdir flask_app
cd flask_app
touch app.py requirements.txt Dockerfile
```

## Step-2: Implement the Python application logic inside the **app.py** file

In this step you will write the application code inside the **app.py** file, which will serve as the main entry point for your Flask application.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# In-memory task list
tasks = []

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Welcome to the Flask Todo App"

@app.route('/tasks', methods=['GET'])
def get_tasks():
    return jsonify(tasks)

@app.route('/tasks', methods=['POST'])
def add_task():
    data = request.get_json()
    task = {'id': len(tasks) + 1, 'title': data.get('title')}
    tasks.append(task)
    return jsonify(task), 201

@app.route('/tasks/<int:task_id>', methods=['DELETE'])
def delete_task(task_id):
    global tasks
    tasks = [t for t in tasks if t['id'] != task_id]
    return '', 204

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')

```

## Step-3: Add the necessary dependencies to the **requirements.txt** file

At this stage you should list all required Python packages in the `requirements.txt` file to ensure the application runs correctly.

```bash
flask
```

## Step-4: Write the **Dockerfile** instructions to build the image for this application

In this step you will create a `Dockerfile` that contains all the necessary instructions to build a Docker image for your Flask application. This includes setting up the base image, installing dependencies, copying application files and defining the command to run the app.

```bash
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY app.py .

CMD ["python","app.py"]
```

## Step-5: Build the docker image

In this step you will build the docker image using the `Dockerfile` you created in the previous step. This process packages your Flask application and its dependencies into a portable image that can run consistently across different environments.

```bash
docker build -t flask-app .
```

## Step-6: Run the Docker Container

In this step you will run a Docker container from the image you built. This will start your Flask application in an isolated environment making it accessible via the specified port on your local machine or server.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name=flask-app-container --restart=always flask-app
```

**Note**: `--restart=always` Ensures the container automatically restarts if it crashes, or when the Docker daemon restarts. Useful for keeping the app running continuously.

## Step-7: Test the application in the browser and CLI

1. Test in the Browser: Open your browser and navigate to

```bash
http://localhost:5000
http://your_machine_ip_address:5000
```

2. Test ugin CLI: You can also test the application from the command line using `curl`

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000
```
